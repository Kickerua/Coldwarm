Plugin for Adobe Photoshop for tweaking colors temperature

![Coldwarm image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17378315/ColdWarm/1.png)

This plugin was developed in 2012 during my Adobe Extension Builder trial period since then it became quite popular, but it requires a decent update. I suppose it doesn't work in newer versions of Photoshop CC.

This source code could be helpful for recreation of this plugin with some modern adobe plugins stack(javascript?). I hope it's not so crappy as it were in 2012.

Feel free to contact me in case any help required.
